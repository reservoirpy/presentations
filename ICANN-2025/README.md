This is a [Tutorial](https://sites.google.com/view/reservoircomputing2025/tutorial) presented at the [3rd Reservoir Computing workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/reservoircomputing2025/workshop-program) held at [ICANN 2025](https://e-nns.org/icann2025/rc/).

The aim is to:
- make participant familiar with [ReservoirPy library](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy) the most popular reservoir library in Python;
- give you quick insights on several key features;
- propose a quick hackathon and see which participant manages to reach the best performances while testing some of our different reservoirs models:
  - [ES2N node](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy/tree/master/examples/Edge%20of%20Stability%20Echo%20State%20Network)
  - [Intrinsic Plasticity](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy/tree/master/examples/Improving%20reservoirs%20using%20Intrinsic%20Plasticity))
  - [Next Generation Reservoir Computing](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy/tree/master/examples/Next%20Generation%20Reservoir%20Computing)

Note that if you already installed ReservoirPy more than one month ago, you would need to upgrade it to the new main version, because this tutorial won't work with previous main 0.3 version. Indeed, we now move to version 0.4 with several main new features (see the last [main release of ReservoirPy0.4](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy/releases/tag/v0.4.0)).
